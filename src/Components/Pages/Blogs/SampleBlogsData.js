        "description": "##### Wondering how to build muscle fast when your schedule is already packed? Building muscle takes time and effort, but there are science-backed ways to make building muscle faster without having to live in the gym.\n\n##### To build muscle fast, you will need a science-backed workout plan and a nutrition strategy. Strength training is key if you want to build muscle fast while also burning off some of the fat that can hide those lean gains.\n\n##### A meta-analysis uncovered that resistance training not only helps build muscle but can also “reduce body fat percentage, body fat mass and visceral fat in healthy adults.\n\n##### The fitness world can be confusing. It seems like everyone has big claims, and they often don’t line up. In this article, each point is backed by peer-reviewed research.\n\n##### Let’s jump in and discover nine science-backed ways how to build muscle fast.\n\n## 1. Do Compound Lifts\n\n##### Compound lifts are exercises that require the movement of multiple joints while working on many muscle groups at the same time. Some examples of compound lifts are the bench press, squat, deadlift, overhead press, and pull-up.\n\n##### Research shows that compound lifts can help you build muscle faster with less time in the gym because you are working a variety of muscles as opposed to exercises that target only one muscle at a time.\n\n## 2. Stay in the Muscle-Building Game\n\n##### One of the fastest ways to put your muscle-building goals on hold for weeks, months, or even years is to sustain an injury. By learning the proper form while getting stronger in the big five compound lifts, research indicates you will strengthen your core, which is key for preventing injuries.\n\n##### Learning the proper form for these compound exercises will help prevent injuries in the gym and also during daily tasks.\n\n##### For example, learning to properly perform the deadlift will help prevent injuries that could happen when moving heavier objects like a couch or bed. Learning to perform the bench press can help with pushing a car out that is stuck in the snow.\n\n##### One way to learn to perform these exercises is to work with a personal trainer or physiotherapist. Others might be able to watch exercise tutorials and work with a partner to get the proper form down.\n\n##### Skipping this step to go straight into lifting heavy weights can lead to muscle imbalances or injuries.\n##### As physiotherapist and founder of Functional Movement Systems, Gray Cook, explains, it is essential to learn to: First move well, then move often.\n\n## 3. Build a Strong Foundation\n\n##### Taking the time to learn the key lifts with lower weight and higher reps is an important step for beginners and people who have not worked out for a while.\n\n##### This is a key first step before moving on to lifting heavier weights. This will help you develop a foundation of core strength, muscular endurance, and stability necessary to support the joints and maintain proper posture throughout your muscle-building journey\n\n##### Building muscular endurance with lower weight and higher reps can also help build impressive muscle. For instance, multi-sport professional athlete, Hershel Walker, bench pressed 375lbs without lifting weights. Instead, he focused on doing super high reps of bodyweight exercises.\n\n##### If you haven’t been to the gym in a while, your workout routine for the first two to six weeks might consist of performing the following three times a week:\n\n - ##### Three core exercises \n - ##### Bench press \n- ##### Squat\n- ##### Deadlift\n- ##### Overhead press\n- ##### Pull-ups\n\n##### Following the guidelines from the National Academy of Sports Medicine, you might aim to perform one to three sets of the above exercises for 12 to 20 reps with little or no weight. Start with a weight at which you can easily perform 12 reps.",

        "title": "6 Tips to Stop Procrastinating Your Life",
        "titleUrl": "6-tips-to-stop-procrastinating-your-life",
        "description": "##### We’ve all done it before. You have an important task to do, but you can’t bring yourself to do it until the last night. Eventually, the deadline comes, and you complete the task, but you’ve wasted a lot of time and caused yourself much-unneeded anxiety in the process.\n\n##### Procrastination seems harmless at first, but when you look back after a year (or even a day), you realize that you could’ve accomplished so much more. Don’t live with those regrets. By shaking off your procrastination tendencies for good — all things will become more manageable.\n\n##### The most obvious place that procrastination will bite you in the butt is in your business. But you will want to begin eliminating procrastination in all areas of your life, not just your business because procrastination is like the common cold — it spreads. The following tips will help you begin your transformation:\n\n## 1. Change Your Habits\n\n##### The first toward abolishing procrastination merely means changing or modifying your habits. A lot of procrastination has to do with your energy levels, and a few habit changes can help you stay energized better during the day.\n\n##### For starters, work on your sleeping schedule and your diet. When you’re getting enough sleep and putting the right nutrients into your body, you’ll have the physical and emotional energy to tackle much more difficult tasks — at least you’ll feel like you can — and that’s half the battle (and it IS a battle). It’s a simple and cliche solution, but it will really work.\n\n##### Other habits include organization, posture, and mental health practices (I just sat up straighter and smiled, try it). Any positive habit you can instill in yourself will help you shrug off procrastination as you put your body and mind in the right place.\n\n## 2. Report Your Progress\n\n##### Accountability goes a long way toward turning procrastination into productivity. When you have someone to report to, you’re more likely to kick yourself into gear to avoid letting them down. Additionally, they’ll be able to check in on you and make sure you’re making progress. Even more — the people you report to — including yourself — will be able to depend on you.\n\n##### Who you choose to hold you accountable depends on the nature of the task you keep procrastinating. For work-related tasks, you probably have a team leader or manager that already oversees you. If you don’t report to anyone directly, ask someone if they can help you stay accountable for your projects.\n\n##### For personal duties, who do you choose to keep you accountable? If you’re doing something like trying to lose weight, a close friend or a spouse will make you a good workout partner — or at least they can check to see if you accomplished your goals. You can report daily exercise and meals using an app and coordinate times to hit the gym together using your Calendar.\n\n## 3. Create a Sense of Urgency\n\n##### The most viewed Ted Talk on YouTube is called “Inside the Mind of a Master Procrastinator.” Presenter Tim Urban uses hilarious and relatable analogies to dissect the mind of a procrastinator. It’s a must-see presentation, but we’ll only take out one important detail for this article. Urban states that nothing will get a procrastinator moving like a sense of urgency.\n\n##### You have likely felt the urgency that Urban describes when a deadline was looming. You might have known about a school assignment all week long, but the sense of urgency didn’t kick in until the night before. To stop this cycle from continuing, create your own urgency.\n\n##### Incentives are a solid way to spur a sense of urgency when all else fails. You can promise yourself a nice treat or a much-needed break if and only if you complete that task you’ve been avoiding all day. It works kind of like the carrot-on-a-stick, but you end up with the carrot after your labor.\n\n## 4. Break Down Your Tasks\n\n##### One of the examples that Tim Urban used in his presentation was his college thesis. Even though he had been given months to work on this 90-page assignment, he couldn’t even bring himself to begin the project until three days before the deadline.\n\n##### To avoid the stress and anxiety Urban must have felt during those short days of cramming and sleepless nights, try breaking down your large tasks and projects. As you divide up large tasks into more manageable pieces, you can set short-term deadlines to complete pieces of the project.\n\n##### Let’s take that thesis, for example. If you have to write 90 pages over three months, it’ll be easier to plan out a page a day. That already sounds much more feasible and has lots of little deadlines to spur some urgency in your work ethic.\n\n## 5. Schedule Your Breaks\n\n##### Procrastination doesn’t only occur over long periods of time. You can procrastinate a task until the end of the day or even the end of the hour. While these small doses of procrastination might seem less significant, they really add up over time and drag your productivity through the mud.\n\n##### What is it that causes you to procrastinate throughout the day? For most, it may be an itching desire to scroll through social media or check in on a mobile game. If you keep picking up your phone throughout the day, you’ll inevitably push back your deadlines until the end of the day. You’ll waste a lot of hours in this cycle.\n\n##### Instead of allowing your phone or other distractions to control you in this way, try scheduling your breaks with your Calendar. Then, concentrate your efforts on not checking phone notifications or wandering for a snack until your scheduled break occurs. Then, instead of allowing yourself to be pulled toward every distraction for endless amounts of time, you’ll ensure that you get at least something done before you kick your feet up.\n\n## 6. Visualize Your Goals\n\n##### Most people have goals and aspirations in life. However, few people take the initiative to chase them down. Procrastination is a big reason why those dreams remain unfulfilled.\n\n##### One way to stop procrastinating on your goals is to visualize them. This could be as simple as putting a picture of your family or your dream home at your workstation. The constant visual reminder will help motivate you to push forward even when your subconscious wants to continue pushing work back.\n\n##### You can accomplish so much more with your life if you’re able to overcome procrastination. It will be a long journey, but small improvements made every day will set the stage for an incredibly successful and event-filled 2022. You don’t want to procrastinate on ending procrastination. You can do this — and good luck!",

These conditions cost millions of dollars per year and cause numerous problems for their victims including depression, anxiety, poor sleep quality, and even heart attack. As long as these conditions do not become serious enough to require medical intervention, simple lifestyle changes may be able to help reduce your risk of developing them or at least slow down the progress of any that have already been developed. In addition to making a change in diet and exercise habits, there are several things you can do to maintain good health. One of those things is to monitor your own body’s condition on a daily basis; if you notice any indicators of illness, take action before they get worse. If you want to know how to keep track of your health, read on.\n\n![fitness](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1605296867304-46d5465a13f1?ixlib=rb1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MTJ8fGZpdG5lc3N8ZW58MHwwfDB8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60)\n\n##### 1. You Can Get Sick Without Knowing It\n\nYou may not have any symptoms until it's too late. There are many different ways to get sick without even knowing it. When you're tracking your health, you'll know if something isn't right before it gets worse.\n\n#####  2. You May Be Able To Prevent Illness\n\n When you track your health, you can find out what foods work best for you and how much exercise you need to stay healthy. By eating well and exercising regularly, you can prevent illness.\n\n ##### 3. You Will Know If Something Is Wrong\n\nIf you notice a change in your body, you can go to the doctor and get checked out. You might feel tired, bloated, or have pain. These could be warning signs of a problem.\n\n ![yoga](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1571019613454-1cb2f99b2d8b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8M3x8aGVhbHRofGVufDB8MHwwfHw%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60)  \n\n ##### 4.

You can walk instead of drive everywhere.\n\n ##### 5. You Can Take Care Of Yourself\n\nKeeping track of your health helps you take care of yourself. You can learn about nutrition and fitness and figure out what works best for you.\n\n ##### 6. You Can Help Others\n\nPeople who don't track their health often don't realize they have a problem until it's too late to do anything about it. By tracking your own health, you can help others avoid making the same mistakes.\n\n##### 7. You're not getting enough sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can lead to weight gain, depression, anxiety, and even heart disease. If you don't get enough sleep, your body doesn't have time to repair itself and recover from the day's activities. When you're tired, you tend to eat more than usual, which can cause weight gain. Sleep deprivation also makes it harder to focus at work, which can lead to job loss or poor performance.\n\n![sleep](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1541781774459-bb2af2f05b55?ixlib=rb1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8M3x8c2xlZXB8ZW58MHwwfDB8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60)\n\n#####  8. You're eating too much sugar\n\nSugar is addictive and causes cravings. Consuming too much sugar increases insulin levels, which can lead to obesity. Sugar also spikes blood pressure and contributes to diabetes. In addition, consuming too many sugary foods can increase your risk of cancer.\n\n#####  9. You're not exercising\n\nExercise helps keep your body fit and healthy. It burns calories, boosts your mood, and reduces stress. Exercise also keeps your brain sharp and prevents dementia. However, if you're not active, you may find yourself gaining weight and feeling sluggish.\n\n![exercise](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583454110551-21f2fa2afe61?ixlib=rb1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MTd8fGV4ZXJjaXNlfGVufDB8MHwwfHw%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60)\n\n#####  10. You're not drinking enough water\n\nDrinking plenty of water is essential to staying hydrated and keeping your skin looking fresh and radiant. Water also flushes out toxins from your system and helps regulate your body temperature. Dehydration can make you feel tired, irritable, and weak.\n\n#####  11. You're not taking care of your mental health\n\nMental illness affects millions of people each year. Depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are just some of the conditions that can affect your mental health. Mental health problems can take over your life and prevent you from enjoying everyday tasks.\n\n#####  12. You're not managing your stress\n\nStress is unavoidable, but it doesn't need to control your life. Stress management techniques help you manage your emotions and stay calm under pressure. Meditation, yoga, breathing exercises, journaling, and mindfulness are all ways to reduce stress. ",
